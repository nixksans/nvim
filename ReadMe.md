# Nicks NeoVim Setup

## Started with
```git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim ~/.config/nvim```

## Install the Plugin Manager lazy.nvim:
```git clone https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/lazy/start/lazy.nvim```

## File Explorer
The configuration uses **nvim-tree.lua** for browsing files.
Toggle it with `<leader>e` (space + e). Files are displayed with icons thanks to **nvim-web-devicons**.

## Fuzzy Finder
The setup includes **telescope.nvim** with the **telescope-fzf-native** extension
for faster fuzzy searching.
Launch it with `<leader>f` (space + f).
